# Contributing

We welcome contributors.  Discussion can be had on the
[#pallet channel on Freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net#pallet).

Please report issues on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/palletops/lein-uberimage/issues).

Patches are preferred as GitHub pull requests. Please use topic
branches when sending pull requests rather than committing directly to
develop in order to minimize unnecessary merge commit clutter.
